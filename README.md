# CVRocketLeagueController
Want to play Rocket League, but the game's just too easy with standard controls? Turn your arms and eyes into the controller!

Uses OpenCV to take video feed as input for the controller, and the program X360CE (https://www.x360ce.com/) will take the output axes from the CVRocketLeagueController and turn those into Xbox360 Controller output for Rocket League to use.
